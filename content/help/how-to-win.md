# How to Win - Your Competitive Advantage

Your "How to Win" strategy defines the specific competitive advantage that will enable you to succeed in your chosen markets and achieve your winning aspiration.

## Key Guidelines

- **Define your unique value proposition** - What makes you different and better?
- **Identify your competitive advantages** - What can you do that others cannot?
- **Consider cost vs. differentiation** - Will you compete on price, uniqueness, or both?
- **Think about sustainability** - How will you maintain your advantage over time?
- **Connect to customer needs** - How does your advantage create value for customers?

## Strategic Questions to Consider

- What unique capabilities or assets give you an edge in your chosen markets?
- Why will customers choose you over alternatives?
- How will you create value that competitors cannot easily replicate?
- What would make it difficult for others to copy your approach?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Focusing only on features rather than customer outcomes
- Choosing advantages that don't align with your "Where to Play" choices
- Advantages that are easily copied or not sustainable
- Competing on price alone without other differentiation
