# Management Systems - Supporting Strategic Execution

Your "Management Systems" are the organizational processes, structures, and mechanisms that enable you to execute your strategy and develop your core capabilities effectively.

## Key Guidelines

- **Design systems that enable your core capabilities** - What processes, structures, and mechanisms do you need?
- **Align with your competitive advantage** - How will systems support your "How to Win" strategy?
- **Consider measurement and feedback** - How will you track progress and make adjustments?
- **Think about organizational design** - What structures, roles, and governance are needed?
- **Plan for capability development** - How will systems help build and maintain capabilities?

## Strategic Questions to Consider

- What management systems are absolutely critical to execute your strategy?
- How will you measure progress toward your winning aspiration?
- What organizational structures and processes enable your core capabilities?
- How will you ensure alignment across all parts of your organization?
- What systems will help you maintain your competitive advantage over time?
