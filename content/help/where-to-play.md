# Where to Play - Strategic Market Choices

Your "Where to Play" choices define the specific markets, customer segments, and competitive arenas where you will focus your efforts to achieve your winning aspiration.

## Key Guidelines

- **Be specific about customer segments** - Who exactly are you serving?
- **Define geographic boundaries** - Which markets, regions, or locations?
- **Choose product/service categories** - What offerings will you focus on?
- **Consider distribution channels** - How will you reach customers?
- **Set competitive boundaries** - Which competitors will you face directly?

## Strategic Questions to Consider

- Which customer segments offer the best opportunity to achieve your winning aspiration?
- What markets are you uniquely positioned to serve better than competitors?
- Where can you build sustainable competitive advantages?
- Which segments align with your core capabilities and resources?

## Example "Where to Play" Choices

**For a Fintech Startup:**
"We will serve small business owners (1-50 employees) in the US who currently struggle with traditional bank lending, focusing on e-commerce and service businesses that need working capital loans under $100K, reached through digital channels and partnerships with accounting software providers."

**For a Sustainable Packaging Company:**
"We will serve mid-market consumer brands ($10M-$500M revenue) in North America who are committed to sustainability goals, focusing on food & beverage and personal care categories, selling direct to brand manufacturers and through packaging distributors."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Being too broad ("everyone is our customer")
- Choosing markets based on size alone rather than fit
- Ignoring competitive dynamics in chosen segments
- Selecting segments that don't align with your winning aspiration
