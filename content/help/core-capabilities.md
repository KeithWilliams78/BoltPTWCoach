# Core Capabilities - Building Strategic Strengths

Your "Core Capabilities" are the distinctive skills, knowledge, processes, and assets that enable you to execute your "How to Win" strategy and achieve your winning aspiration in your chosen markets.

## Key Guidelines

- **Focus on capabilities that enable your competitive advantage** - What must you excel at to win?
- **Identify both current strengths and gaps** - What do you have vs. what do you need?
- **Think beyond just skills** - Include processes, technologies, relationships, and assets
- **Consider capability integration** - How do different capabilities work together?
- **Plan for capability development** - What will you build, buy, or partner for?

## Strategic Questions to Consider

- What capabilities are absolutely critical to deliver on your "How to Win" strategy?
- Which capabilities would be hardest for competitors to replicate?
- What do you need to be world-class at versus just good enough?
- How do your capabilities reinforce each other to create competitive advantage?
- What capability gaps could prevent you from executing your strategy?
